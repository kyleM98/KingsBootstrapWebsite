                    <h5 id="scrum">What is a scrum?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

                        Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products. Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.  This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrumâ€™s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. </p>
                    <p>The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.</p>    
  
                    <h5 id="sprint">What is a Sprint?</h5>
                    <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.
                      With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces</p>
                      <p>There are typically 4 steps to a sprint in order for it to be successful:
                        <ol> 
                            <li><strong>Sprint planning</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Daily scrum/ stand-up</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Sprint review</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Sprint retrospective</strong></li>
                            
                         </ol>
                      </p>

                    <h6 id="planning">Sprint planning</h6>  
                    <p>Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.</p>
                    <p>You need to decide on how long the time box is going to be, the sprint goal, and where you're going to start. The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by setting the agenda and focus. If done correctly, it also creates an environment where the team is motivated, challenged, and can be successful. Bad sprint plans can derail the team by setting unrealistic expectations.</p>
